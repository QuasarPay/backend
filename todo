DONE


rn---------------


---------------

contacts, -> since users already signup with their phone numbers, we just need a way to cross ref
  with existing users and create a "friend request of sorts".
  
  this ends up being a many to many thing

  we might be able to circumvent these relationships by adding more tables (later)

  nah this is just one to many in this case (just 2 user ids in it, it is a mapping table already)

  for now:
    upload contacts list
    send contact link request

    get in app contacts list (tag by accepted, pending, declined)
------------------



what is a subscription
-> has an invite link (could be more than one person)
-> has preset rules 
-> has an action attached (loan repayment, savings)
--------------





user, contact loans








#invite other users to contact list
